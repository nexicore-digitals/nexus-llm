# 🛣️ Nexicore Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of NexusLLM and Nexi’s cognitive architecture. It reflects our commitment to modularity, contributor empowerment, and ethical orchestration.

Every milestone is a neuron. Every release is a signal. Every flow is alive.

---

## 🧠 Phase 1: Core Shell & Plugin Interface (✅ Complete)

- ✅ Modular router (`NexusLLM.ts`)
- ✅ Plugin interface (`Plugin.run(input, context)`)
- ✅ Model wrappers (Gemini, Mixtral, Phi-2/3)
- ✅ Contributor registry (`CONTRIBUTORLIST.md`)
- ✅ Schema system (`NexusDSM.v1`)
- ✅ LICENSE.nexicore for orchestration protection

## 🧩 Phase 2: Cognitive Routing & Contributor Flows (🔄 In Progress)

- 🔄 MCP routing logic (Model–Context–Policy)
- 🔄 Plugin chaining and fallback orchestration
- 🔄 Contributor-aware personalization
- 🔄 Reviewer-style output (`suggestion`, `explainer`, `confidence`, `reviewerNote`)
- 🔄 Premium access logic (`account.isPremium || contributor.secretBadge`)
- 🔄 Memory hydration via `MemoryPlugin`

## 🔐 Phase 3: Privilege-Aware Access & Nexi-as-a-Service

- 🧪 Account system for premium users
- 🧪 Hosted orchestration layer (Nexi-as-a-service)
- 🧪 Plugin registry with access control
- 🧪 Streaming support for emotional architecture
- 🧪 Contributor onboarding UI (manual + form-based)
- 🧪 Badge verification and license-aware routing

---

## 📚 Phase 4: Educational Tooling & Community Growth

- 📎 Modular onboarding flows for new contributors
- 📎 Reviewer dashboard with traceable plugin output
- 📎 Schema builder with plugin suggestions
- 📎 Community-driven plugin gallery
- 📎 Contributor feedback loop (learning goals → plugin hints)

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Agentic Evolution

- 🧠 Nexi becomes a repo-native agent
- 🧠 MCP logic adapts based on contributor state
- 🧠 Plugins teach and explain, not just execute
- 🧠 Nexi audits its own context and invites review
- 🧠 Living artifacts (README, LICENSE, SCHEMAS) evolve with usage
